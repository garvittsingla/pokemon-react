# Pokemon React App

This is a basic Pokemon React application that displays a list of Pokemon with their details such as height, weight, and abilities. The application fetches data from the PokeAPI and allows users to search for specific Pokemon. The main focus of this project is on functionality rather than a complete UI design.
